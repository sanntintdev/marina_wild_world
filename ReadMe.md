# Marina Wild World - Zoo Website Project

## Author: Sann Tint Aung ( S1035447 )

## Notes for Instructor

-   I have used tailwind css for this project instead of bootstrap css because I wanted to have control over the design and layout of the website. It may look a bit different and complex sentence structure because of tailwinds utility classes.

-   I have used Lucide Icons for icons and SweetAlert2 for custom alerts as JS Library.

-   I have used custom JavaScript for form validation, page transitions, and interactive elements.

-   I connected images & media with links from the internet because of the file size limit in the submission. So if you want to see the images, you need to have an internet connection. There will be some chances that the images may not load properly because of the internet connection or the link is broken.

-   Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project and for all your teaching and guidance. I hope you like my project.
